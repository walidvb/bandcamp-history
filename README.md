# BANDCAMP HISTORY TAB

A simple extension that (locally) tracks your visits to bandcamp albums and tracks, to display them in a 'history' tab on your account page


### Future plans

- only add to history if sound was played
- get correct image when syncing history
- add time separators to the list(last week, last month, etc..)
- make the items playable(like in the collection tab)
- make the list searchable
- figure out when to add items, and when to bring them to the top(at the moment if the same url in the past 20 visits, it won't be pushed to the front)
- handle status of the track(purchased, added to wishlist etc)
